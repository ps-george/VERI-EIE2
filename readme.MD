# VERI_EIE2 2016 Lab

### George Punter and Timothy Mayoh
-----------------------------------
This is the electronic logbook for the VERI lab in the Autumn Term of 2016 at Imperial College London, Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering.

The goal of this lab was to develop an understanding of digital design, this involves:

1. Using a Hardware Description Language (HDL), specifically Verilog, instead of schematic diagrams.
2. Creating reusable _modular_ components to prevent oneself from reinventing the wheel every time.
3. Synchronising to system clocks to ensure predictability in the functioning of the design.
4. Exploring the practical implementation quirks of some of the more complex circuitry introduced in lectures.

The experiment consisted of 4 parts:
- [Part one](/part_1) - Decoders for hex to 7-segment and binary to BCD (Binary-coded Decimal)
- [Part two](/part_2) - FSMs (Finite State Machines): Counters, starting line lights, and reaction meter.
- [Part three](/part_3) - Digital to analogue conversion and sinewave generators
- [Part four](/part_4) - Audio processing: Amplify x4, and Single, Multiple & Variable Delay Echo Synthesiser
