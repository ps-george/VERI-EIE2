# Experiment 10 - Interface with the MCP4911 Digital-to-Analogue Converter



# Experiment 11 - D-to-A conversion using pulse-width modulation



# Experiment 12 - Designing and testing a sinewave table in ROM



# Experiment 13 - A fixed frequency sinewave generator

1) 10Hz period because getting a sample every 10kHz and have 1K samples for one cycle

# Experiment 14 - A variable sinewave generator


# Experiment 15 - Using the A-to-D convertor to adjust the frequency of the sinewave
