# Ex1

* Programmed FPGA with solution - needed to delete FPGA file instead of SOCVHPS
* Implemented out[4] of 7seg_decoder, leaving optimisation of truth table to Quartus
* Assigned pins in pin planner after running Analysis and Elaboration.
* Compiled project and programmed FPGA with our .sof file, tested the output.

# TimeQuest Timing Analyzer Report
Delay difference: 85C is around 0.5ns slower than 0C, this is because at higher temperatures resistance in the circuit increases, slowing down current flow.

# Ex3

* Changed top level Verilog file to use three of the hex_to_7seg modules created earlier. 


# Ex4
